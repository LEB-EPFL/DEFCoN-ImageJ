DEFCoN-ImageJ
=============

An ImageJ plugin for DEFCoN, the fluorescence spot counter based on
fully convolutional neural networks

This is the ImageJ plugin for the density estimation by fully
convolutional networks (`DEFCoN`_) algorithm, an image processing tool
for fluorescence spot counting. With this plugin, you can use trained
DEFCoN models directly on images from within ImageJ.
