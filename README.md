# DEFCoN-ImageJ

- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ)

This is the ImageJ plugin for the [density estimation by fully
convolutional networks (DEFCoN)](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN)
algorithm, an image processing tool for fluorescence spot
counting. With this plugin, you can use trained DEFCoN models directly
on images from within ImageJ.

# Quickstart

1. Download the latest DEFCoN-ImageJ.jar file from
   [releases](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ/releases) and
   put it in your ImageJ/Fiji plugins folder.
2. Launch ImageJ/Fiji and open an image or stack of images that
   contains fluorescent spots.
3. Navigate to *Plugins > DEFCoN* and choose to compute either the
   density map or the maximum local count.
4. Specify the location of a saved DEFCoN model. This will be a folder
   that contains a TensorFlow SavedModelBundle and is generated by
   training the [DEFCoN](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN) network.
