# DEFCoN-ImageJ

- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ)

This is the ImageJ plugin for the [density estimation by fully
convolutional networks (DEFCoN)](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN)
algorithm, an image processing tool for fluorescence spot
counting. With this plugin, you can use trained DEFCoN models directly
on images from within ImageJ.

# Quickstart

1. Download the latest DEFCoN-ImageJ.jar file from
   [releases](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ/releases) and
   put it in your ImageJ/Fiji plugins folder.
2. Download a density map network from the [DEFCoN-ImageJ
   Wiki](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN-ImageJ/wiki). Unzip it
   anywhere you like.
3. Launch ImageJ/Fiji and open an image or stack of images that
   contains fluorescent spots.
4. Navigate to *Plugins > DEFCoN* and select *Density map...*.
5. Specify the location of the folder containing the DEFCoN density
   map network model that you downloaded and unzipped in step 2. This
   will be a folder that contains a TensorFlow SavedModelBundle and is
   generated by training the
   [DEFCoN](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/DEFCoN) network.
6. Click OK to compute a density map estimate from the images.
